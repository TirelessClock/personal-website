Started work on 27th March, 2022. Finished an initial draft by 1st April. Got busy with a lot of other stuff, put it off since I had no idea how to do JavaScript.  

Started learning JavaScript from videos etc. on 23rd March. Lost interest within hours - saw no practical use of any of it. Put it off again in favour of DS/Algo + Open Source.

Found time on 2nd May and 3rd May. Started working on a genuine plan of operation, decided I will learn along the way. Scraped the original version.

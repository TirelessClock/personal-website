            <h2>Hello There!</h2>
            I'm Abhimanyu Dayal. If you've reached this far, I guess you already know that. <br>
            All the (other) cool kids were making their own websites, so I thought I should have one too. <br>Feel free to explore!

            <h2>
                Who am I?
            </h2>
            I'm a fresher student at DTU. My other dimensions include artist, writer, programmer and pop culture enthusiast. I love Chess (don't bother asking my rating I haven't played at that level), TypeRacing, Table Tennis and sketching. <br>My life's dark ages ended recently after three years, with the end result being me clearing the Joint Engineering Entrance (JEE) Exams Mains and Advanced with brilliant ranks, resulting in my admission to Software Engineering at DTU. 
            <br>Since my admission, and finally finding time to myself, I have gotten way into programming, gaining (work in progress) profiency in C++ and Python in various stratas of Computer Science like Machine Learning, Web Development (behold!) and Data Structures/Algorithms.
            <br>I'm fluent in English and Hindi, and have a working proficiency with French. 
            <br>All the above mentioned facets of my life I have documented in this website in some form or the other. Do check 'em out.
